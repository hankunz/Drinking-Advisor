Group-13-Project-CSCI3130
=========================

The repository is created one day before the deadline of iteration 1, so there is no process recorded. Our group has been using Google drive to share codes and files since the begining. The reason is that we thought we can choose either google drive, sky drive, or githup to keep track of our working progress. However, our group has always been working in agile. For more details, please check documentation on google drive.
